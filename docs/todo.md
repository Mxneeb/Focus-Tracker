- [x] Clarify project scope and requirements with the user. Key clarifications include: Python preference, lightweight performance, fine-tunable CV models, local data processing, deferred sound/voice feedback, initial inclusion of adaptive coaching and reward system, specific attention metric calculation, coaching persona, and initial game genre focus (Fortnite, Brawlhalla).
- [x] Research existing Python-based technologies and libraries for face detection, facial landmark detection (e.g., MediaPipe, Dlib), head pose estimation, emotion recognition (with fine-tuning capabilities), eye tracking, and lightweight UI overlays (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, or game engine overlays if feasible). Findings summarized in `research_summary_cv.md`.
- [x] Design the system architecture, outlining main components (Input, CV Module, State Classification, UI Widget, Feedback Module, Adaptive Coaching, Reward System, Local Data Storage) and their interactions. Documented in `system_architecture.md`.
- [x] Define algorithms for metrics (Attention, Fatigue, Frustration, Engagement, Distraction) and the logic for state classification. Documented in `metric_algorithms.md`.
- [x] Draft the UI/UX for the overlay widget, including layout, visual design, interaction flow, and notification system for buddy messages and rewards. Documented in `ui_ux_design.md`.
- [x] Compile a comprehensive feature and behavior specification document, integrating all previous findings and designs. Documented in `feature_and_behavior_specification.md`.
- [x] Validate the design and specification with user feedback. User approved specifications and requested to proceed with development.
- [ ] Develop the initial codebase for GameBuddy Focus Tracker. This includes setting up the project structure, implementing core modules (Input, CV, Metric Calculation, basic UI), and ensuring local data handling.
