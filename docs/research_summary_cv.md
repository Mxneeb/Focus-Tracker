# Technology Research Summary for GameBuddy Focus Tracker

This document summarizes the findings from researching Python libraries for face detection, facial landmark detection, emotion recognition, and UI development for the GameBuddy Focus Tracker project.

## Computer Vision Libraries:

1.  **MediaPipe (Google AI Edge):**
    *   **Features:** Provides solutions for face detection, face landmark detection (478 landmarks), and facial expression/blendshape scores (for emotion inference). Optimized for real-time performance on various platforms, including desktop (Python API available).
    *   **Pros:** Highly efficient, good for real-time applications, detailed landmarking, provides blendshapes which are useful for nuanced emotion/expression analysis. Supports live stream processing.
    *   **Cons:** Emotion recognition is indirect (via blendshapes) and might require additional logic to map to specific emotions like frustration, fatigue, etc. Fine-tuning pre-trained models might be complex.
    *   **Suitability:** Strong candidate for core facial tracking and expression analysis due to performance and detailed landmarks.

2.  **DeepFace:**
    *   **Features:** A lightweight framework wrapping several state-of-the-art models (VGG-Face, FaceNet, OpenFace, DeepFace, DeepID, ArcFace, Dlib, SFace) for face recognition and facial attribute analysis (age, gender, emotion, race).
    *   **Pros:** Easy-to-use API for direct emotion recognition (angry, fear, neutral, sad, disgust, happy, surprise). Supports multiple backends, allowing flexibility. Lightweight.
    *   **Cons:** May rely on other libraries (like Dlib or OpenCV) for initial face detection. Performance for real-time continuous analysis needs to be benchmarked for this specific use case. Fine-tuning specific emotion models might depend on the underlying model chosen.
    *   **Suitability:** Very good for direct emotion classification. Could be used in conjunction with a faster detector/landmarker if needed.

3.  **Dlib:**
    *   **Features:** A C++ library with Python bindings. Offers robust face detection (HOG-based and CNN-based) and facial landmark detection (e.g., 68-point model). Known for a good balance of speed and accuracy.
    *   **Pros:** Accurate and relatively fast, especially the HOG-based detector for CPU usage. Widely used and well-documented. Pre-trained models are available.
    *   **Cons:** Emotion recognition is not a built-in feature; would require custom logic based on landmarks. CNN-based detector is more accurate but slower without GPU.
    *   **Suitability:** Excellent for face detection and landmarking if MediaPipe proves too complex for certain aspects or if a different landmarking scheme is preferred.

4.  **RetinaFace:**
    *   **Features:** A deep learning-based face detector, part of the InsightFace project. Provides facial area coordinates and basic landmarks (eyes, nose, mouth).
    *   **Pros:** State-of-the-art detection accuracy, especially in crowded scenes. Can be used as a detector backend for libraries like DeepFace.
    *   **Cons:** Primarily a detector; emotion recognition and detailed expression analysis would require other libraries or custom models. Might be more resource-intensive than MediaPipe or Dlib's HOG detector for real-time CPU-bound applications.
    *   **Suitability:** Could be a powerful face detector if extreme accuracy is needed, potentially feeding into other libraries for landmarking and emotion analysis.

## Eye Tracking:

*   Most facial landmark detection libraries (MediaPipe, Dlib) provide landmarks for the eyes. These landmarks can be used to estimate gaze direction (relative to the head), blink rate, and eye openness. This will be crucial for the "Attention Level" and "Fatigue Level" metrics.
*   No dedicated
